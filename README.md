# Boame API

A service marketplace backend that connects customers to vetted providers for domestic and commercial services — starting with car wash and home cleaning, with plans to expand across more service categories.

Built by **Asante** as a full-stack portfolio project demonstrating production-grade backend architecture. Pairs with the [Boame Client](https://github.com/littlegod20/boa_me_client) (React Native / Expo).

---

## What it does

Customers open the app, browse available services, pick a provider, book and pay securely via Mobile Money or card. Providers receive job requests, confirm bookings, and get paid automatically after completing a job. Both parties can chat in realtime throughout the process.

## Database Design

11 tables covering the full service marketplace domain:

- **users** — customers, providers and admins with role-based access
- **providers** — provider profiles with MoMo/bank payout details
- **provider_services** — junction table linking providers to services with individual pricing
- **categories** — service categories (Home Services, Car Services)
- **services** — platform-defined service catalogue
- **bookings** — full booking lifecycle with state machine
- **payments** — Paystack transaction records with webhook verification
- **transactions** — financial audit trail for payouts and refunds
- **reviews** — post-completion ratings (1-5) tied to specific bookings
- **conversations** — chat threads between customer and provider
- **messages** — individual chat messages with seen status

## Key Features

### Authentication
- Email/password registration with email verification
- JWT access tokens with refresh token pattern
- Google OAuth 2.0 via Passport.js
- Forgot password with SHA-256 hashed reset tokens
- Role-based access control (customer, provider, admin)

### Booking State Machine
Bookings follow strict validated transitions:

```
pending_payment → pending_confirmation → confirmed → in_progress → completed
                                      ↘ cancelled ↙
```

- Customers can only cancel
- Providers can confirm, start, complete, or cancel
- Invalid transitions are rejected at the API level

### Payment System
- Customer pays at booking time via Paystack (MoMo or card)
- Payment initialisation returns a hosted Paystack checkout URL
- Webhook handler verifies Paystack HMAC-SHA512 signature before processing
- **Cancellation policy:**
  - Provider cancels → full refund to customer
  - Customer cancels after confirmation → 96% refund (4% cancellation fee to provider)
  - Cancelled before payment → no charge
- Provider payout triggered automatically 24 hours after job completion via RabbitMQ worker
- Platform takes 10% commission on each completed payout

### Realtime Messaging
- Socket.io with JWT authentication on connection
- Users automatically join all their conversation rooms on connect
- Messages saved to PostgreSQL and emitted to room simultaneously
- Message seen status tracking

### Caching Strategy
- Categories cached for 1 hour
- Services cached for 30 minutes per query combination
- Provider listings cached for 10 minutes
- Cache invalidated automatically on write operations

## Planned Features

- **Dispute Resolution** — customers can flag unsatisfactory completed bookings for admin review. Admins can investigate, resolve or reject disputes, with optional compensation flow.
- **Push Notifications** — Expo Push Notifications for booking confirmations, status updates, payment receipts and new messages via Firebase Cloud Messaging.
- **Image Uploads** — provider profile photos and ID verification documents uploaded directly to Cloudinary from the React Native client using unsigned upload presets.
- **Admin Dashboard** — web-based dashboard for managing users, services, disputes, and viewing platform analytics.
- **Apple OAuth** — Sign in with Apple alongside existing Google OAuth.
- **React Native Frontend** — mobile app for iOS and Android built with Expo.



## What I Learned

This project pushed me significantly beyond CRUD. The most valuable lessons:

- **Payment system design** — handling the full money lifecycle: initialize, verify via webhook, conditional refunds based on who cancels, automated provider payouts with commission deduction
- **State machines** — modeling booking lifecycle as validated transitions rather than a simple status field prevents invalid states at the database level
- **Async architecture** — decoupling payout processing from the request/response cycle using RabbitMQ and node-cron so HTTP responses stay fast
- **Realtime systems** — Socket.io rooms, authentication on connection, and saving messages atomically while emitting to conversation participants
- **Caching strategy** — knowing what to cache, for how long, and critically when to invalidate
